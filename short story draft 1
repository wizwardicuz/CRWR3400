A knight's Tale

A tear mixes with the ashes on the ground.
I'd wipe it away were it not for the gauntlet on my hand.

I dislike being here, the marks of my failure as a knight all around me.
But I saw it every time I closed my eyes, when I slept and when I dreamed.
It called to me and I could ignore it no longer.

"Sam..." His name hovers in the air, alone.

I can't find anything else to say.
How could I possibly say anything when he paid the ultimate price and I did not?
A roar echoes across the valley, so powerful it rattles my armour even from miles away.
By instinct I reach for my blade, my hand pausing halfway there.

*What good will I do?
I have already failed once.*

A sob rings in my helmet.
I take it and tuck it safely under my arm, letting my tears flow freely.

"Sam..."
I try again, voice strained with tears.
A sob interrupts my thoughts and I gather my thoughts again.
In the distance, another roar goes off and while my heart quivers, I find my words.

I grasp my sword and pull it free.
I place it point down against the ground, and kneel.

"Sam, I promise you, your sacrifice will not be in vain.
I will fight that beast and slay it, even if it takes my own life as well.
No one should have to do what you did."

I don't know how long I stayed kneeling there, another roar chocking me out of my stillness.
I put my helmet on, reach for my sword, and again my hand stills.
But this time not from a lack of character.

*There is no way I can fell this beast as I am now.
It is two strong and I am not prepared.*

Grabbing and sheathing my sword, I sigh.
I walk the out of the ashen remains of the hut to my horse outside.
Despite the ground shaking with demonic roars, she is still waiting exactly where I left her.
I brush her mane and look into her eyes that betray her nervousness.

"Good girl, I know it's scary out here.
Thanks for waiting," I smile.
"But we have one more stop to make."

I give a gentle tug on her reigns and together we shamble towards the remains of the church, its toppled steeple still smoking in the graveyard.

I stop and tie her to the gate outside, giving her mane a few calming brushes.

"Be a good girl and stay here."

I untie my sword from my belt and strap it to her saddle.

"God needs neither challenge or protection," I mutter my masters old adage to myself.

Sufficiently unarmed, I enter the church.
Unlike the rest of the town, it appears to have come out relatively unscathed.
Rainbow dust sits in piles beneath where decorative windows gleamed, bus aside from the steeple outside, everything else is intact.

"The works of man may fall, but God remains."

I walk past the pews and head up to the alter.
carefully, I rearrange the fallen candles and offerings, placing the bible back upon its stand.
Then, I kneel and pray.

"Lord, this house may be empty, but not of you.
It has been defiled by a destructive beast who sent you many of your children before their time.
One of those given to you is my squire, Sam, who was far more brave than I could ever hope to be.
I ask for permission to slay the beast in his name.
I also ask for the strength and wisdom to complete this task, as I lack the power to do it alone.
Praise be to you and all your glory.
In your name I pray, amen."
