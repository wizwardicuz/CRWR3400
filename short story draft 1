A knight's Tale

A tear mixes with the ashes on the ground.
I'd wipe it away were it not for the gauntlet on my hand.

I dislike being here, the marks of my failure as a knight all around me.
But I saw it every time I closed my eyes, when I slept and when I dreamed.
It called to me and I could ignore it no longer.

"Sam..." His name hovers in the air, alone.

I can't find anything else to day.
How could I possibly say anything when he paid the ultimate price and I did not?
A roar echoes across the valley, so powerful, even from miles away it rattles my armour.
By instinct I reach for my blade, my hand pausing halfway there.

*What good will I do?
I have already failed once.*

A sob rings in my helmet.
I take it and tuck it safely under my arm, letting my tears flow freely.

"Sam..."
I try again, voice strained with tears.
A sob interrupts my thoughts and I gather my thoughts again.
In the distance, another roar goes off and while my heart quivers, I find my words.

I grasp my sword and pull it free.
I place it point down against the ground, put my helmet atop and kneel.

"Sam, I promise you, your sacrifice will not be in vain.
I will fight that beast and slay it, even if it takes my own life as well.
No one should have to do what you did."
